# Notes on Posting News

To post news, make an appropriate entry in `_posts`, copying the main title info.

* If you want to include a social media preview image, flag it as an image in the title block:

# image: images/copa-logo-small.png

* If you want to include a read more, mark it as such:

<div class="bold--excerpt--node">Read More</div>
<!--more-->

After editing the file, expect it to take a few minutes to post. The repo owners will receive a failure or success message afterward.
