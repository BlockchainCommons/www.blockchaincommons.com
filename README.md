**Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure & compassionate digital infrastructure**<br>
**To enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online**

Blockchain Commons works with developer communities to design, build, and maintain secure & compassionate decentralized architectures & tools for digital assets & digital identity based on responsible key management; based on our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness; and based on our [Self-Sovereign Identity Principles](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md). Our goal is to reclaim human dignity & authority in the digital world. We also strive to educate & grow the blockchain community through online courses and our work with legislators and regulators.

Blockchain Commons is proudly a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation, domiciled in Wyoming but operating world-wide. We have a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy: anyone can use or improve our tools, and no one can take them away.

Our current projects include:

* [Gordian Products & Technologies](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) — reference apps that demonstrate the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles).
   * [Gordian Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) — our premiere reference app, demonstrating how to closely hold a seed and still use it for active management of keys.
* Web demos — demonstrations of specs and apps such as [Lifehash](https://lifehash.info/) and [Seedtool](https://seedtool.info/).
* [Research](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research) — Technical descriptions and docs for our interoperable and open infrastructural and architectural specifications, such as [Uniform Resources (URs)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md), [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md), and [Lifehash](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info).
* [Crypto Commons Libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons) — reference libraries providing access to interoperable and open infrastructural and architectural specifications, including [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [Uniform Resources (URs)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), [Lifehash](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash), [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords), and more.
* [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) — our educational course introducing blockchains and Bitcoin development.
* [#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/) — our educational course laying out the foundation of responsible key management.

We also offer services to the improve the security and infrastructure of the larger blockchain ecosystem:

* Infrastructure — support of Tor exit nodes and other blockchain infrastructure & software.
* Security Reviews — risk-based assessments of custody methodologies, operational security procedures, and layer-2 protocols such as payment channels.
* Project Support — contractual support of our open-source projects such as Gordian Seed Tool and for our specs and libraries.

If you are interested in working with us directly on a Security Review or Support for using a project with your business, please [contact us](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com).

These are just the beginning! Blockchain Commons is also working on other cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, and documentation. Our more future-looking research includes work on identity wallets, social-recovery techniques, zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs, advanced cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr, MuSig, and scriptless scripts, and in general establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
