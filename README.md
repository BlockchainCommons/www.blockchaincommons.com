**Blockchain Commons advocates for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny.**

Blockchain Commons works with developer communities to design, build, and maintain secure & compassionate decentralized architectures & tools for digital assets & digital identity based on responsible key management; based on our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness; and based on our [Self-Sovereign Identity Principles](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md). Our goal is to reclaim human dignity & authority in the digital world. We also strive to educate & grow the blockchain community through online courses and our work with legislators and regulators.

Blockchain Commons is proudly a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation, domiciled in Wyoming but operating world-wide. We have a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy: anyone can use or improve our tools, and no one can take them away.

We also offer services to the improve the security and infrastructure of the larger blockchain ecosystem:

* Infrastructure — support of Tor exit nodes and other blockchain infrastructure & software.
* Security Reviews — risk-based assessments of custody methodologies, operational security procedures, and layer-2 protocols such as payment channels.
* Project Support — contractual support of our open-source projects such as Gordian Seed Tool and for our specs and libraries.

If you are interested in working with us directly on a Security Review or Support for using a project with your business, please [contact us](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com).

These are just the beginning! Blockchain Commons is also working on other cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, and documentation. Our more future-looking research includes work on identity wallets, social-recovery techniques, zero-knowledge curve-operation proofs, advanced cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr, MuSig, and scriptless scripts, and in general establishing multi- and cross-blockchain standards.
