Blockchain Commons produces projects that fulfill its [Vision](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html). Much of this centers on an **Architecture** that focuses on our Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness and that encourages responsible key management. This Architecture is built upon **Use Cases**, **Specifications** that enable those Use Cases, and **Developer Support** for incorporating those Specifications including Reference Libraries and CLI Apps. **Reference Apps** offer further examples to ensure that Specifications are integrated using best practices. Beyond its architectural core, Blockchain Commons also supports **Events**, **Educational Projects**, **Advocacy Projects**, and **Open Infastructure Projects**.

## The Gordian Architecture

**Repo:** [Gordian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian)<br>
**Introduction:** [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Architecture/README.md), [Roles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/Architecture/Roles.md)<br>
**Q&A:** [Why CBOR?](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Why-CBOR/)

_The Gordian Architecture is the heart of Blockchain Commons' work. It's a partitioned architecture and a set of backup, communication, and encoding specifications, built to support the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles)._

The Gordian Architecture supports users through those four principles.

* **Independence.** The Gordian Architecture supports self-sovereign control of digital assets. Users are in control, not centralized organizations.
* **Privacy.** The Gordian Architecture is privacy-protecting, allowing selective protection and disclosure of data.
* **Resilience.** The Gordian Architecture focuses on [#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/index.html) to eliminate Single Points of Failure and Compromise; controlling your own assets can be tricky, and the Gordian Architecture makes it as safe as possible while also maximizing security.
* **Openness.** The Gordian Architecture helps developers to come together using open specifications that allow interoperability.

The Gordian Architecture is an future-looking design that covers everything that from the high-level architecture of a Gordian ecosystem through the specifications and UX best practices that make it possible. It allows blockchain, wallet, and web developers to deploy fully featured applications that incorporate all the current best practices of the digital-asset community.

## Gordian Specifications

The Gordian architecture is built on specifications that empower our [Vision](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html). These specifications are what create the independence, privacy, resilience, and openness of our designs.

### Envelope Specification

**Repo:** [Secure Components](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents), [Envelope-CLI](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/envelope-cli-swift) <br>
**Intros:** [Introduction to Gordian Envelopes](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/), [Technical Intro](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Intro-Tech.md), [Use Cases Intro](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/README.md)
**Docs:** [Docs](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/tree/master/Envelope#articles)
**Videos:** [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcnpYqHn8NQ), [Envelope Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCkrqxOY1FbooYwJ7ZhpJ_QQk8Az1aCnG)

 The Secure Components suite provides tools for easily implementing encryption (symmetric or public key), signing, and sharding of messages, and representation of knowledge graphs, including serialization to and from CBOR and UR formats. The core of the Secure Components capability suite is the Envelope. This is a smart-document structure that supports the storage, backup, encryption & authentication of data, with explicit support for Merkle-based selective disclosure.

### Lifehash Specification

**Repo:** [Overview & Web Demo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web)<br>
**Video:** [Explainer Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu0K__KLxKo)

LifeHash is a method of hash visualization based on Conway's Game of Life that creates beautiful icons that are deterministic, yet distinct and unique given the input data. The basic concept is to take a SHA256 hash of the input data (which can be any data including another hash) and then use the 256-bit digest as a 16x16 pixel "seed" for running Conway’s Game of Life.

LifeHash is used by Blockchain Commons to create distinct and unique visual representations for your seeds and keys, so that you can recognize them at a glance.

### SSKR Specification

**Paper:** [UR Type Definition for Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md)<br>
**Security Review:** [2021 Review](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md)<br>
**Documents:** [SSKR Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md), [SSKR Share Scenarios](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md), [SSKR Dangers](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md)

Blockchain Commons SSKR is an implementation of Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR) for use in Blockchain Commons Software Projects. It currently implements Shamir's Secret Sharing, allowing for sharding and reconstruction of a key, to improve Resilience.

### Uniform Resource (UR) Specification

**Papers:** [Uniform Resources (URs)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md), [Registry of UR Types](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md), [UR Type Definitions for Transactions Between Airgapped Devices](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md), and others<br>
**Documents:** [UR Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-overview.md), [UR Introduction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md)<br>
**Blog:** [Blockchain Commons’ Uniform Resources (URs) Support Airgapped PSBTs & More](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/Blockchain-Commons-URs-Support-Airgapped-PSBTs/) (12/8/20)<br>
**Test Vectors:** [crypto-request](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-request-test-vectors.md), [crypto-seed](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md), [SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md)

UR stands for Uniform Resources, a method for encoding structured binary data in plain-text strings that are also well-formed URIs. It's an interoperability specification that allows for the reliable, typed transfer of data and was designed in particular to allow for reliable transmission of crypto-seeds, crypto-keys, PSBTs, and other data related to cryptocurrency.

One of the particular advantages of UR is careful integration with QR codes, a prime method for transmitting data across airgaps. URs are built to be efficient when encoded as QRs. In addition, multi-part URs allow for the creation of animated QRs, overall containing more information than any single QR could have.

### Research Papers

**Repo:** [Research](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research)<br>
**Video:** [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY)

Most of our specifications begin with Research papers, which describe and detail the use of new, interoperable specifications for blockchain and Bitcoin.

## Gordian Developer Support

_The Blockchain Commons repos include libraries and apps that help developers to develop and test the Gordian specifications._

### Crypto Commons Libraries

**Repos:** [Crypto Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons#gordian-reference-libraries)

All of the Gordian reference libraries can be found in the Crypto Commons repo. Libraries are originally coded in C or C++, but the repo also contains implementations of some libraries for Java, Python, Swift, or other languages.

### Developer Apps

**CLI Apps:** [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords-cli), [Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/envelope-cli-swift), [Keytool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-keytool-cli), [LifeHashTool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool), [Musign-CLI](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli), [Seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli) <br>
**iOS Apps:** [URDemo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URDemo)<br>
**Web Apps:** [lifehash.info](https://lifehash.info/), [seedtool.info](https://seedtool.info/), [Spotbit]([spotbit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit)

Apps for the command-line and for iOS and the web can aid developers in testing out their work.

<hr>

## Gordian Reference Apps

Whereas Developer Apps are meant for testing, the Gordian Reference Apps offer best practices and examples of how to incorporate Reference Libraries into applies that support the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles).

### Collaborative Seed Recovery

**Introduction:** [CSR Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/CSR/README.md)<br>
**Next Step:** [CKM Overview](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/CKM/README.md)<br>
**Videos:** [CSR Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk)

Collaborative Seed Recovery, or CSR, is currrently Blockchain Commons' major project, being developed in coordination with a number of partners. It's a system intended to automate the recovery of seeds and other sensitive digital data in a way that is safe, secure, and simple to use. It is not a methodology to prevent compromise, but simply to add resilience to recovery in the case of failure or loss. It is an exemplar for how to introduce a key management role into a Gordian Architecture.

CSR is a step toward [Collaborative Key Management (CKM)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/CKM/README.md), which is expected to become an active project following the deployment of current CSR systems. Currently, CSR is planned for 2022 and CKM for 2023-2024.

### Gordian Reference App: Coordinator (iOS)

**Repo:** [Coordinator](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-GordianCoordinator)

Gordian Coordinator is a Multisig Bitcoin transaction coordinator for iOS. It demonstrates the use of request and response envelopes to communicate when creating multisig transactions in a way that is both resilient and easy to use.

<a href="images/projects/Cosigner.png"><img src="images/projects/SeedTool.png" style="border: 1px solid black; float: left; margin-right: 1em" width="110"></a>
### Gordian Reference App: Seed Tool (iOS)

**Repo:** [Seed Tool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS)<br>
**Blog:** [Gordian Seed Tool Reveals the Foundations of Cryptography](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/apps/SeedTool-Release/) (7/15/21)

Gordian Seed Tool is Blockchain Commons' most fully featured reference app. It demonstrates independence and resilience by protecting your cryptographic seeds while also making them available for easy use. Using Seed Tool, you can generate seeds and store them securely on your device. You can then derive and share multi-signature signing and verification keys from those seeds or alternatively sign PSBTs directly from the app. Sophisticated backup procedures demonstrate the usage of Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction ([SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.md#sharded-secret-key-reconstruction-sskr)) — which lets you split your seed into pieces and send them to trusted parties, who can send them back to you in an emergency for seed recovery. You can even use an entirely offline device (no internet access) to store your seeds and use QR codes to exchange necessary information with online devices running compatible wallet or signing software. A complete [manual](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md) details its functionality.

### Gordian Reference App: Server (MacOS)

**Repo:** [Gordian Server](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS)<br>

Gordian Server installs a self-sovereign Bitcoin Core server, protected by Tor, on your Mac computer. This gives you complete control over your Bitcoin destiny, and supports easy connectivity with [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS), [Fully Noded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fully-noded/id1436425586), and other wallets that support the [QuickConnect API](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/QuickConnect/README.md).

<a href="images/projects/lethekit.jpg"><img src="images/projects/lethekit.jpg" align="right" border="1" width="200"></a>
### Gordian Reference App: LetheKit (kit)

**Repo:** [lethekit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit)<br>
**Blog:** [Blockchain Commons Releases Feature-complete LetheKit](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/apps/Releasing-LetheKit/) (10/28/20)

LetheKit is a do-it-youself platform for performing various sensitive cryptographic operations on an offline airgapped device. It uses no WiFi or Bluetooth which could leak information and contains no local storage, and when the device is turned off it forgets any sensitive data stored in RAM. Thus the name Lethe (lee-thee), from the [mythological river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe) of forgetfulness and oblivion.

### Other Gordian Reference Apps

**Legacy Repos:** [Cosigner iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianCosigner-iOS), [Cosigner Android](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android), or [Cosigner macOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS), [Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)<br>
**Research Repos:** [Mori-CLI](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli), [Sweeptool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli)

Several other reference apps have been released to demonstrate specific Principles. Some of these apps have since become outdated or superceded by other applications. Several research reference apps have been written to test out new technologies and new ways to demonstrate our Vision, but haven't been upgraded to full reference status.

_The Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets._ This five-chapter (186-page) book is intended to make you rethink the security of your digital assets. It puts together a risk-modeling system with two additional building blocks: a cold-storage scenario for managing self-custody; and an extensively detailed list of potential adversaries. By working through the book, you can determine which adversaries are actually the most dangerous to your assets, and adjust your own self-custody scenario to accomodate them. Additional chapters talk about fiduciary duties with regard to digital assets. 

A v2.0 of this book is in the planning stage, to improve the accessibility of the course, to support additional hardware tools, and to introduce multi-signature scenarios. Our [multisig design article](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md), our [sharding design article](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md), our [SSKR Dangers article](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md), [Timelock exploration article](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md), and our [multisig scenario](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md) will all be incorporated into #SC 2.0 in some form, per our [#SC 2.0 outline](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md).
