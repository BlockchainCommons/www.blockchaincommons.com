Blockchain Commons' mission is to advocate for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny. We are proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source, open development, and defensive patents.

## Why Sponsor?

Our mission is funded entirely by donations and collaborative partnerships with people like you. Every contribution will be spent on building open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastructural architectures, and on creating demand and peers for these systems.

Your personal or corporate patronage can help us to further the development of these projects. Together, we can ensure that digital data is personally controlled in a way that supports independence, privacy, resilience, and openness and that protects technology & digital civil rights; with your gift, we also can remain independent while doing so. 

Please consider becoming a Patron of Blockchain Commons though ongoing monthly patronage as a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons). You can also support Blockchain Commons with bitcoins at our [BTCPay Server](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/).

**[Bitmark](https://bitmark.com/)** is a technology company focused on establishing and protecting your rights. It was founded in 2014 to fix and restore trust in the Internet. They wanted to show the world that being able to trust data would lead to a better future for all. Today, Bitmark builds not only the protocol to restore trust in data but also consumer apps that empower humans in the digital age.

<img src="images/sponsors/chia-logo.png" width=400>

**[Chia Network](https://www.chia.net/)** built a better blockchain to drive real-world use and application. Founded by Bram Cohen, inventor of BitTorrent, Chia provides a secure, sustainable and regulatory compliant blockchain setting the standard for the infrastructure of digital currency and inclusive access to global, decentralized finance. Through the innovative Proof of Space and Time consensus algorithm, Chia Network’s public, open-source blockchain leverages hard drive space to create the first new Nakamoto Consensus since Bitcoin in 2009.

**[CrossBar](https://www.crossbar-inc.com/)** is a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology. ReRAM technology serves as the foundation for multiple flavors of non-volatile memory (NVM) — multi-time programmable (MTP), few time programmable (FTP) and one-time programmable (OTP) —  as well as for implementing high performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage, such as in digital asset and financial applications.

**[Digital Contract Design](https://contract.design/)** creates Contracts with Trust Minimization. Since 2017, unsecured loans of dollars have required large amounts of coin to be used as collateral with escrow agents, requiring trust in the escrow agent. DCD is working toward a variety of smart contracts that secure collateral on the blockchain (or a sidechain), based on receipt of triggering signatures from a reliable BTCUSD price oracle.

<img src="images/sponsors/foundation-logo-black.png" width=500>

**[Foundation](https://foundationdevices.com/)** is the creator of Passport, a next-gen hardware wallet that makes it easier than ever to securely store your Bitcoin. They believe that Bitcoin and decentralized technologies will empower the individual, leading to a better world where people control their own data and their own money. Foundation is building a new category of sovereign computing devices.

<img src="images/sponsors/proxy-black.png" width=500>

**[Proxy](https://www.proxy.com/)** has more than five years' experience in the digital-identity space and is now building on their work in innovating tokenized credential technology for use on the smartphone by creating a personal identity product for mass adoption, to bring the promise of web3, decentralization, and self-sovereign identity to everyone.

<img src="images/sponsors/unchained-capital-black.png" width=500>

**[Unchained Capital](https://www.unchained-capital.com/)** is a new kind of financial services company. They are the first collaborative asset management firm that offers loans and vaults for your Bitcoin. It was founded by people who believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the world but only if they're useful. They set out to build financial products for long-term crypto-investors to get more value from their assets today and in the future.
