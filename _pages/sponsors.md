Blockchain Commons' mission is to advocate for human dignity online by enabling people to control their own digital destiny. We are proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source, open development, and defensive patents.

## Why Sponsor?

Our mission is funded entirely by donations and collaborative partnerships with people like you. Every contribution will be spent on building open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate infrastructural architectures, and on creating demand and peers for these systems.

Your personal or corporate patronage can help us to further the development of these projects. Together, we can ensure that digital data is personally controlled in a way that supports independence, privacy, resilience, and openness and that protects technology & digital civil rights; with your gift, we also can remain independent while doing so. 

Please consider becoming a Patron of Blockchain Commons though ongoing monthly patronage as a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons). You can also support Blockchain Commons with bitcoins at our [BTCPay Server](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/).

**[Chia Network](https://www.chia.net/)** built a better blockchain to drive real-world use and application. Founded by Bram Cohen, inventor of BitTorrent, Chia provides a secure, sustainable and regulatory compliant blockchain setting the standard for the infrastructure of digital currency and inclusive access to global, decentralized finance. Through the innovative Proof of Space and Time consensus algorithm, Chia Network’s public, open-source blockchain leverages hard drive space to create the first new Nakamoto Consensus since Bitcoin in 2009.

**[CrossBar](https://www.crossbar-inc.com/)** is a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology. ReRAM technology serves as the foundation for multiple flavors of non-volatile memory (NVM) — multi-time programmable (MTP), few time programmable (FTP) and one-time programmable (OTP) —  as well as for implementing high performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage, such as in digital asset and financial applications.
