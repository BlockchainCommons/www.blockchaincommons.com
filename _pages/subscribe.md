To continue the discussions of our interoperable work, Blockchain Commons hosts:
1. Discussions forums on Github.
2. Low-volume announcement lists.
3. Signal groups.

Please join us for topics that interest you!

## Gordian Developers

Blockchain Commons holds a monthly Gordian Developer Meeting, usually on the first Wednesday of the month, typically at the Europe-friendly time of 10am PT. This meeting is for wallet developers and engineers working on specs for wallet developers to exchange their newest advances and to ask their newest questions. _Please join us!_

If you'd like to become a member of the Gordian Developer community, and receive announcements about upcoming meetings and the release of new resources, you can do so by  joining us on Signal, participating in our Discussions forums, or subscribing to our low-volume Gordian Developers announcement list.

You can find our Signal group at:

## FROST Implementers

If you are a FROST implementer who is working on the spec and/or libraries or apps that are intended to be used by other developers, we invite you to our FROST Implementers mailing list. This very low-volume announcements-only list will let you know about new events such as our Implementer's Round Table that will give you the opportunity to talk with other FROST implementers.

## SSI Tenth Anniversary

It's the tenth anniversary of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and its [ten principles](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/#ten-principles-of-self-sovereign-identity). We are recognizing that with the 10-year SSI Revision Project, an effort to revisit and refine the original SSI principles, not as a rigid standard, but as a living framework for people designing, governing, and deploying identity infrastructure that respects and protects the people it serves. We will be holding open online calls to support this revision and would love to have your collaboration. Sign up here to learn when they are happening!
