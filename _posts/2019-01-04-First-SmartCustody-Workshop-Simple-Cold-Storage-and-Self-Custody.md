### Overview

This is the first of three different kinds of #SmartCustody workshops. This one is focused on individual holders of digital assets, in particular cryptocurrency traders and those high net-worth individuals who are already familiar & working with digital assets, but are are seeking to learn best practices for protecting themselves and their business from theft, fraud, or loss.

Future workshops will be focused on holders of digital assets that have fiduciary responsibility to others, such as small investment funds & family firms, and those who are required to use third-party qualified custodians for management of digital assets due to the amount of funds held.

## What you can expect to learn

The day will cover leading practices for the industry as well as advanced concepts, including but not limited to:

- A simple cold-storage scenario, with detailed checklist
- Detailed case studies of 24 digital asset "Adversaries"
- Digital asset risk modeling & example scenarios
- Hardware & service selection
- Presentations & materials from leading cryptocustody companies.

The day will conclude with an open salon to discuss open questions and options for future collaboration across the industry.
