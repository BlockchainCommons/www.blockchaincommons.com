Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of [DID v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) as a W3C standard!

Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as a standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.

Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in 2015 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a [hack to TLS](https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack) that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses, and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. That same year, Christopher also worked with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network in the XDI Registry Working Group to produce a strawman for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers, which was presented at [IIW 21](https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized).

However, the most direct advancements toward DIDs came out of the of [Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop](https://www.weboftrust.info/) that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers to be published following that first workshop was the massive [Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf), which included as one of its design principles that "each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding", but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.

DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the [ID2020 conference](https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e) at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chaven of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the [Requirements for DIDs](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf), supported by the US Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. That workshop also brought in Manu Sporney, whose work on [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) needed an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.

Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the [DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer's Draft 01](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf) that followed at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston in October 2017, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec.

Christopher was one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group, where he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to present to W3C. He has been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group's specification became an official W3C standard. Our congratulations again to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubating in New York, San Francisco, Boston and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.

Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind [BTCR](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/), which has been dubbed the "granddaddy of DIDs". This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, just like the X.509 cert anchors that Christopher was advocating back in 2015. 

Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not been expanded its work on DIDs beyond Christopher's support for the specification itself, his expertise with DIDs and with BTCR means that it remains an opportunity for the future.
