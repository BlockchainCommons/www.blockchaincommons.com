Thanks to everyone who joined us for our second Silicon Salon, this one focused on **Secure Boot, Supply-Chain Security, and Firmware Upgrades**. Courtesy of some terrific presentations, we were able to get into good depth on these topics, both discussing the state of the art and what we could do better. You can find all the info on the [Silicon Salon 2 pages](https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/) of [siliconsalon.info](https://siliconsalon.info).

At the website, you can find the videos, slides, and transcripts of [all the presentations](https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/presentations/), plus [an overview of the discussion](https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/#discussions). We're also continuing to use our [Silicon Salon topic](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions/categories/silicon-salon) to further these discussions as part of our Community repo.

If you would be interested in sponsoring or planning Silicon Salon 3, either this fall or winter, please [email us](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com).
