The [Gordian Envelope](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/) Smart Document is a powerful new method of data storage and transmission that focuses on protecting the privacy of its contents through cryptographic functions such as signatures, elision, and inclusion proofs. 

But what does that mean? Why would you use it? To answer these questions we've published a set of 24 use cases that not only demonstrate many innovative uses for Gordian Envelopes, but also show precisely how those Envelopes would be structured — because these use cases aren't theoretical, but instead real possibilities with the current iteration of the Gordian Envelope specification.

Most of the following use cases are offered progressively: additional use cases build on earlier ones, expanding the fundamental ideas with new functionality in each example. (That functionality is listed as part of each use case's name.)

## [Data Distribution Use Cases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md)

Data distribution is crucial for a variety of use cases, from the supply chain to the medical industry. The use cases in this section take as an example the distribution of user data based on a [WebFinger](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033.html)-like protocol, highlighting the advantages of building a privacy-first data structure.

#### [**Part One: Public CryptFinger**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md#part-one-public-cryptfinger)

The most fundamental usage of Gordian Envelope is to publish verifiable data that is entirely public.

#### [**Part Two: Private CryptFinger**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md#part-two-private-cryptfinger)

Building on the elision capabilities of Gordian Envelope can produce data that is not (initially) viewable by everyone, but which remains provable and ultimately releasable.

4. [**Carmen Protects CryptFinger (Elision)**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md#4-carmen-protects-cryptfinger-elision) – Eliding data for some viewers and not others.

#### [**Part Three: Herd Private CryptFinger**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md#part-three-herd-private-cryptfinger)

A herd-privacy variant of CryptFinger's design can allow users to maintain their privacy as much as they wish, as discussed in this overview.

#### [**Part Four: Data Distribution Advancements**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Data.md#part-four-data-distribution-advancements)

There are many other options for cryptographic data distribution, building on signatures, provability, repackaging, and encryption permits, as is discussed in this further overview.

## [Financial Industry Use Cases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md)

Although the financial industry can make many uses of Gordian Envelopes to preserve assets, these use cases concentrate on self-sovereign control of assets: how an individual can use Gordian Envelopes to make sure he doesn't lose them. 

#### [Part One: Self-Sovereign Storage of Secrets](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md#part-one-self-sovereign-storage-of-secrets)

Envelopes can simply and securely store digital assets.

1. [**Sam Stores a Secret (Secure Storage with Metadata)**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md#1-sam-stores-a-secret-secure-storage-with-metadata) — Using metadata in an Envelope to increase the resilience of stored assets.
2. [**Sam is Salty about Compliance (Non-Correlation)**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md#2-sam-is-salty-about-compliance-non-correlation) — Salting data to eliminate correlation dangers.
3. [**Sam Gets Paranoid about Privacy (Wrapped Encryption)**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md#3-sam-gets-paranoid-about-privacy-wrapped-encryption) — Improving privacy at the cost of resilience.

5. [**Sam Promotes a Partner (Multi-Permit)**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Envelope/Use-Cases/Financial.md#5-sam-promotes-a-partner-multi-permit) — Improving resilience through multiple permits.

## The Common Thread of Use Cases

The first common thread among the use cases for Gordian Envelopes is the need for secure and privacy-enhancing solutions for transmitting and storing complex, sensitive data. Gordian Envelopes can help to prevent tampering or other security breaches and ensure that only verified, trustworthy data is transmitted. This can be particularly important in industries such as healthcare, finance, and government, where the verifiability of personal data is of utmost concern.

The second common thread is a focus on protecting human rights. The core value proposition of the privacy features of Gordian Envelopes cannot be overstated: through its support for selective disclosure and [progressive trust](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/), Gordian Envelopes allow for disclosure of only specific parts of the data, and only to authorized parties, ensuring that the privacy rights of individuals are respected.

The final common thread is diversity. Data stored in Gordian Envelope may be related to a wide range of industries, have cross-industry contexts, or cross international borders. It often involves diverse parties with different business models, risk models, and trust boundaries. When you have a diversity of users, requirements, and models, Gordian Envelopes can offer a flexible solution that allows different uses for different entities.
