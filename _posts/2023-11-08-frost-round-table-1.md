On November 8, 2023, Blockchain Commons held its first Round Table on FROST. The results have been [published at our FROST developer pages](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/).

The meeting included almost a dozen experts in the field, including members of the [ZF FROST Team](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost) and the [secp-zkp FROST Team](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138). The goal was to overview FROST, and give members of these different teams the opportunity to discuss their individual approaches to FROST. The meeting was a success, with multiple calls for additional round tables in 2024.
