On September 18, 2024, Blockchain Commons held its second Round Table on FROST. Almost twenty expert cryptographers, designers, and developers came together to share the challenges and successes they've had with FROST over the last year as well as the advances of their differing approaches. 

A [full log](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting2/) of the meeting is now available, including video, rough transcript, rough summary, and PDFs of all of the presentations.

Our next FROST meeting will be a FROST Developers meeting, focused on helping wallet developers to implement FROST (and why they might want to). It's scheduled for December 4th. Sign up for our [Gordian Developers mailing list or Signal channel](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/) to receive an invite. 

Thank you to [HRF](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/HRF-FROST-Grant/) for supporting Blockchain Commons' FROST work in 2024.
