> "Cypherpunks wouldn't just critique the surveillance state—they’d also call out us technologists for enabling it. We were supposed to resist, not retrofit."

Christopher Allen recently talked with Tereza Bízková in an interview that was published to the front page of Hackernoon. It was headlined ["The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot"](https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot). In it, Christopher talks about what privacy means to him, what he thinks about recent privacy efforts, how centralization has become a problem, and how all of this connects to work done by the cypherpunks in the '90s. 

Perhaps most importantly, Christopher answers the question: what would be non-negotiable for a new privacy-first system today? His answer unsurprisingly reflects our vision here at Blockchain Commons, built on [data minimization](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/), [progressive trust](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/), and limited scale.

Privacy is one of the fundamental [Gordian Principles](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/), but probably the one we talk about the least, as so much of our focus is on resilience (such as [#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/)) and the [interoperability](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-interop/) that's linked to independence and openness. Read ["The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot"](https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot) for much more on why privacy is important and what exact it is!
