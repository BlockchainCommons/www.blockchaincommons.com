Blockchain Commons was pleased to receive another grant this year from [Human Rights Foundation (HRF)](https://hrf.org/) and their Bitcoin Development Fund grant to support our work with developers and implementers to expand the usage of FROST.

To quote HRF's [press release]((https://hrf.org/latest/hrf-grants-800-million-satoshis-to-22-freedom-tech-projects-worldwide/)):

> "For nonprofits operating under authoritarian rule, securing Bitcoin is critical for survival. If private keys (which control access to bitcoin) are compromised, funds can be seized and movements dismantled. Blockchain Commons is a [not-for-profit] supporting the development of FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signature), a protocol that strengthens multisignature wallets (bitcoin wallets with multiple private keys) by making them more secure, private, and flexible for shared custody. With this grant, Blockchain Commons will help build critical infrastructure to keep civil society groups operational and financially resilient under dictatorships."

Blockchain Commons has previously held and documented [four meetings](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#events) supporting FROST in 2023 and 2024, and we plan to continue with that later in 2025. Thanks to HRF, we also are expanding that work this year with the development of a FROST signing tool and the creation of a brief "Learning FROST from the Command Line" course. Our goal, as ever, is to help support the implementers who are creating FROST and to make it easier for developers to incorporate FROST into their wallets.
