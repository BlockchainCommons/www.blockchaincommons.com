Most of my identity advocacy work in the United States has been in Wyoming. They've been very open to the goals of self-sovereignty and as a result we've passed laws such as [private key protection](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/PrivateKeyWRDABills/) and we've defined digital identity as being controlled by an individual's [principal authority](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/).

So it's great to see another jurisdiction, which I have been less directly involved with, progressing on their own vision of self-sovereignty. That's the whole purpose of advocacy: to seed the ideas so that they spread.

I'm talking about Utah, whose State-Endorsed Digital Identity (SEDI) has been moving in a great direction for a while.  The newest bill introduced for it, [S.B. 275, the "State-Endorsed Digital Identity Program Amendments"](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/SB0275.html), which does all the heavy lifting of establishing SEDI, solidifies it as a privacy-first, decentralized design.

## A Bill of Identity Rights

The first thing that caught my eye in the SEDI update was a new Bill of Rights. It immediately presents the digital-identity user not just as a digital serf, but someone who can claim privileges.

The lead right was surprising:

> (1) "An individual possesses an individual identity innate to the individual's existence and independent of the state, which identity is fundamental and inalienable."

That's pretty close to my first [principle of self-sovereign identity](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/), existence:

> Existence. Users must have an independent existence. Any self-sovereign identity is ultimately based on the ineffable “I” that’s at the heart of identity. It can never exist wholly in digital form. This must be the kernel of self that is upheld and supported. A self-sovereign identity simply makes public and accessible some limited aspects of the “I” that already exists.

It was great to see an understanding that any digital identity is founded in a real person. That lays the foundation for its importance in the digital world.

There was tons more in the bill of rights that was amazing.

This is pretty close to self-sovereignty:

> (2) An individual has a right to the management and control of the individual's digital identity to protect individual privacy.

This requires transparent architecture:

> (7) An individual has a right to transparency in the design and operation of a state digital identity, including the right to access, read, and review the standards and technical specifications upon which the state digital identity is built and operates.

This is a little wobbly (because of the "except as authorized by law"), but is a strike against the surveillance state:

> (10) An individual has a right to be free from surveillance, profiling, tracking, or persistent monitoring of the individual's assertions of digital identity by the state, except as authorized by law.

But this may be my favorite:

> (8) An individual has the right to choose what identity attributes are disclosed by the individual's state digital identity in accordance with standards established by the Legislature.

This is potentially full empowerment of selective disclosure, depending on what the standards are. I wrote [recently](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/XIDs-True-SSI/) that one of the big failures of the SSI community is the fact that they stepped away from a holder being able to determine what they can redact in their identity. That a state legislature may beat them to the punch is shocking.

I think a digital-identity bill of rights is a great thing. It's what I was thinking about when I put together the original [principle of self-sovereign identity](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/). I'm now [revisiting](https://revisitingssi.com/) those principles for the SSI 10th anniversary, and this looks like another great source to consider.

## The Duty of Loyalty

There's a ton to like in the bill, including anti-correlation, selective disclosure, minimal disclosure, and a variety of requirements for digital-wallet providers, verifiers, and relying parts that all tend to protect the holder of the identity. It's clear that someone was involved who really knew what they were doing and also undestood the importance of a user controlling their own identity.

But the other one that I thought was of particular note was the "Duty of Loyalty"

> 63A-20-701. Duty of loyalty. The department, a digital wallet provider, a verifier, a relying party, and a digital guardian shall refrain from practices or activities related to the processing of an individual's identity attributes that:
>
> (1)conflict with the best interests of an individual;
>
> (2)take advantage of or otherwise exploit an individual;
>
> (3)result in a disproportionate risk to an individual;
>
> (4)are to an individual's detriment; or
>
> (5)cause harm to an individual.

This is a critical right, tying into the [Principal Authority](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/) work that I did with the Wyoming Blockchain Select Committee. It similarly evokes agency law to say that when other entities are using your digital identity, they can only do so to support *your* best interests. Compare that to the modern-day ecosystem of surveillance capitalism and extraction and the difference is obvious. Many modern-day digital services are built on allowing you to create an identity (on Facebook, on Google, whatever) and then mercilessly extracting from that, stealing your attention, your creativity, and everything else.

There are obviously questions with how this will be managed. For one, I can't see how "related to the processing of an individual's identity attributes" will be interpreted. Obviously, it'll protect you from hi-jinks on the part of your verifier (which is a huge win) but it's unclear whether it'll provide any protection for someone who is enabling you to interact online with your identity (e.g., Facebook).

The other question is whether entities can coerce users to give up this right, which is a common modern-day tactic (c.f. "clickwrap"). From the research I've done so far (IANAL), it looks like these aren't rights that could be signed away in a contract—they represent minimum statutory requirements, and that as long as carve-outs aren't created in the law, this Duty of Loyalty will be protected.

That's what we need to fight against here. We need to "beware platforms bearing gifts": we have to watch for Googles and Facebooks using regulatory capture to ask for carve-outs in this law that will steal away the rights from _us_ and give it to _them_ by making them optional. And that's unfortunately a pretty big task in the modern world.

## Make a Difference

I haven't analyzed every line in [S.B. 275](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/SB025.html). I wouldn't be surprised if I find some things I don't agree with as I explore it further. But in the big picture, this is a big win for self sovereignty and for user agency and autonomy in digital identity. Adding it on to Wyoming's work creates another model for how digital identity that maintains human dignity could spread across the United States.

If you want to help in this effort:

* **If you're in Utah**, call up your state representatives and tell them that you support the bill. Maybe even express concerns about regulatory capture.
* **If you're in another state**, call up your state representative and tell them of your interest in self-sovereign identity, offering [Utah SB275](https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/SB025.html), [Wyoming SF39](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039), and maybe [Wyoming HB86](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/HB0086) as model legislation.
* **If you want to support our advocacy**, become a [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or [talk to me directly](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com) about supporting advocacy at a larger scale.

The work going on in Utah is great. But it's just a start in supporting our digital rights!
