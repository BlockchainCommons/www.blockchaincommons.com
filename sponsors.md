Blockchain Commons' mission is to support open blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry. We are proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation committed to open source & open development. 

## Why Sponsor?

Our mission is funded entirely by donations and collaborative partnerships with people like you. Every contribution will be spent on building open tools, technologies, and techniques that sustain and advance blockchain and internet security infrastructure and promote an open web. 

Your personal or corporate patronage can help us to accomplish to further the development of open infrastructure projects. Together, we can expand and improve the blockchain infrastructure that's used by our entire industry, and with your gift, we can remain independent while doing so.
