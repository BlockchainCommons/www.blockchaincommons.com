The goal of Blockchain Commons is to bring together a community of developers and users that are creating and using secure decentralized computing systems that maintain the human dignity of their users and that allow them to personally control (or delegate) their digital identity and their digital assets.

To accomplish this goal, we've laid out four objectives:

1. **Blockchain Commons.** Create a specific commons that is dedicated to the realization of open infrastructure for secure, compassionate, decentralized systems.
   * Our [Airgapped Wallet Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community) is one of the ways that we've brought together a community focused on working to create this Commons.
2. **Architecture:** Research, define, and evangelize an interoperable architecture for secure decentralized systems that support independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.
   * Our [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian), our [Research Papers](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research), and our [Crypto Commons libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons) embody our architectural work.
3. **Demand:** Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.
   * This comes about in part from our architecture, but also from our [Testimony](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Testimony) to various agencies.
4. **Peers:** Increase the demand for, and population of, people who understand the effective development, and use of, secure decentralized systems.
   * Our [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) and [SmartCustody](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody) projects work toward this objective, as does the [documentation](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.md) of our own work.
