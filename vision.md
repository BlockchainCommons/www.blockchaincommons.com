## Vision

Blockchain Commons supports human dignity online by allowing people to control their own digital destiny.

## Objectives

To accomplish this Vision, Blockchain Commons has laid out four objectives:

1. **Blockchain Commons.** Create a specific commons that is dedicated to the realization of open infrastructure for secure, compassionate, decentralized systems.

   * We reach out to the user & developer communities to identify problems and assess needs in current decentralized blockchain systems.
   * We focus on interoperable solutions and open architecture that allow companies to cooperate with individuals while staying focused on what makes their own business or projects unique. 
   * Our [Airgapped Wallet Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community) brings together a community focused on working to create this commons.

2. **Architecture:** Research, define, and evangelize an interoperable architecture for secure decentralized systems that supports independence, privacy, resilience, and openness and that encourages responsible key management.

   * We design, build and maintain decentralized architectures for digital assets and digital identity.
   * We create tools that everyone can use, anyone can improve, and no one can take away. 
   * Our [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian), our [Research Papers](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research), our Gordian reference apps, and our [Crypto Commons libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons) represent our architectural work. They provide a foundation that developer communities such as the [Bitcoin Airgapped Wallet Community] (https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community) can use to create wallets and other tool that embody responsible key management and that adopt our [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.

3. **Demand:** Define and advocate a new techno-social contract of decentralized infrastructure, based on human dignity, respect for the individual, and mutual benefit for all contributors.

   * We work with regulators & legislators to advocate policies to enable and support compassionate decentralized approaches to cryptographic assets and digital identity.
   * Our [Testimony](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Testimony) to various agencies records much of our work to date.

4. **Peers:** Increase the demand for, and population of, people who understand the effective development, and use of, secure decentralized systems.

   * We strive to grow the blockchain developer community through educational courses that help students to effectively develop and use secure decentralized systems and to be  aware of the threats to human dignity that require compassionate solutions. 
   * Our [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) and [SmartCustody](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody) projects as well as our own [documentation](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.md) work toward this objective.

_Blockchain Commons is proudly a "not-for-profit" social benefit corporation domiciled in Wyoming, but operating world-wide. We have a strong commitment to open source and a defensive patent strategy._
